                <p>A good logo grabs attention, makes a strong first impression, is the foundation of your brand identity, is memorable, separates you from competition, ending to foster brand loyalty.</p>
                <p>By a previous analysis of your business or product I make some monochrome previews of your logo, then pick the corresponding colors. <br />Once you logo is ready I can add some animations if you need it like custom loaders.</p>
                <p>If you already have a logo and want to make animations for it, I can make it too.</p>
